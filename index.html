    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I work as a postdoctoral researcher in the Learning and Educational Technology (LET) research lab in the Faculty of Education and Psychology at the Univesity of Oulu. I investigate how people speak to one another and to machines. </p>
            
        <p>My research focuses on the design of AI agents which proactively speak to people and how proactive agent speech impacts people's ongoing tasks. My current research in the Horizon EU funded Teacher-AI Complementarity (TAICo) project focuses on the challenging moments that inhibit collaborative learning and how they can be detected by AI so learners can receive support.</p>

        <p>Before joining the University of Oulu, I completed a PhD about proactive speech between people and machines at University College Dublin's School of Information and Communication Studies, which was supervised by Professor Benjamin Cowan and Professor Julie Berndsen. I have also been a visiting student at University College London's Interaction Centre and Utrecht University's Department of Experimental Psychology. I received my Bachelor's degree from Williams College in 2017 where I studied psychology and cognitive science.</p>
