<h2>Supervision</h2>
<p>I currently am co-supervisor for two PhD students at the University of Oulu. I also supervise two students in the Master's in Learning, Education and Technology (LET) degree program. I have supervised the completed degree of one LET Master's student so far at the University of Oulu. At University College Dublin, I supervised six Master's students in Human-Computer Interaction and Information Systems.</p>
