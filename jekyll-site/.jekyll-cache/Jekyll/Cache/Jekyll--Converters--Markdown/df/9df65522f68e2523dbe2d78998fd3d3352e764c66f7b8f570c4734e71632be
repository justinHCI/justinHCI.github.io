    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I work as a postdoctoral researcher in the Learning and Educational Technology (LET) research lab in the Faculty of Education and Psychology at the University of Oulu. I investigate how people speak to one another and to machines.</p>
        
    <p> My research focuses on the design of AI agents which proactively speak to people and how proactive agent speech impacts people's ongoing tasks. My current research in the Horizon EU funded Teacher-AI Complementarity (TAICo) project focuses on the challenging moments that inhibit collaborative learning and how they can be detected by AI so learners can receive support.</p>
