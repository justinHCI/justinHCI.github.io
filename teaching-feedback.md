        <p>"I learned so many things from this course and both teachers helped me and guide me when I need them I truly happy and appreciate it. The things I learned through this course will be beneficial for my future also. As examples I truly learned more about collaboration, manage my emotions, manage every tasks and try not to harm others emotions. Both of the teachers understand the situation that whats happening within our group and they supported me. it was lot to me and I felt combatable. Overall, I really enjoyed and happy about pilot session and excited to do a better work in research night also. This project really connects with real world and I like that its more focused on hands on activities and opening playfulness aspects also."</p>

        <p>"Your slides were really good. And your teaching was very fluent and so engaging.The graphical representation helped us to understand new concepts."</p>

        <p>"Thanks for the nice lecture. The slides were very clear. I found that warming up the session with an analogy was a good way to start. You managed to engage the audience in discussion during the whole lecture. The final exercise was very ambitious, maybe it would have benefited from longer time or a narrower scope?"</p>

        <p>"Your teaching session was excellent, efficient and clear. It was very well designed with purposeful group task during the lession. You escpecially speaked out loud clearly and your part was easy to follow. Thank you!"</p>
