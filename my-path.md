# My Path

My teaching journey started during my college years, where I studied cognitive and educational psychology. Alongside my studies, I taught college preparatory exam classes to high school students and worked in the recruitment team for a network of independent schools. These early experiences gave me a foundation in the theories of teaching and learning while highlighting the challenges of applying them in real classrooms. It was during this time that I realized education was more than an interest—it was a field I wanted to dedicate myself to. The process of sharing knowledge and seeing students develop skills became a challenge I found both meaningful and rewarding.

During my PhD at University College Dublin, I expanded my teaching experience in various roles, including occasional lecturer, tutorial leader, thesis supervisor, and course instructor. I actively sought out these opportunities to improve my teaching skills and work toward my academic goals. While my ability to shape course content was initially limited, I experimented with different teaching methods, such as scaffolding, integrating technology, and encouraging collaborative learning. These experiences helped me clarify my teaching values and goals, independent of specific course content. At the same time, I became more aware of the practical challenges of teaching, such as balancing research responsibilities, limited contact hours, and the disruptions caused by the Covid pandemic.

Now, as a researcher in the University of Oulu’s Faculty of Education and Psychology, I continue to develop as a teacher. Working alongside colleagues with deep pedagogical expertise has been invaluable. Teaching Masters-level students in the Learning and Educational Technology program has been particularly impactful. Many of these students are experienced educators, which has challenged me to refine my teaching approach and reflect on the unique perspective I bring as a technology researcher. In this setting, constructivist principles are central to my teaching approach. My students help me better understand effective teaching, while I support their development of research skills. This mutual learning process has reinforced my commitment to aligning my teaching practices and philosophy.

Looking ahead, I aim to further bridge the gap between theory and practice, continuing to learn and grow alongside my students. My goal is to create a learning environment where knowledge is shared and built collaboratively and learning is fun, benefiting everyone involved.
